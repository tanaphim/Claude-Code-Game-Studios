# Epic: Phase 3 Hero Migration

**ADR**: [ADR-0006 §10 Phase 2 → Phase 3 Handover](../../../docs/architecture/ADR-0006-phase-2-migration-plan.md)
**Lessons Reference**: [Phase 2 Lessons Learned](../../../docs/architecture/phase-2-lessons-learned.md) — 5 codified patterns
**Pilot**: Sprint 005 S5-01..S5-21 (Hercules, complete 2026-05-14, soaking through 2026-05-21)
**Owner**: gameplay-programmer (`tanapol`)

---

## Goal

Migrate the remaining **15 production heroes** from legacy `SkillKey`-hardcoded paths to the slot-bound (`BoundSlot`/`PressedSlot`) pattern proven in the Phase 2 Hercules pilot. After Phase 3 completes, the dual-path retention layer (`BoundSlot != 0 ? slot : legacy SkillKey fallback`) can be deleted in Phase 4 along with the `SkillKey` enum itself.

## Production roster (16 code-ready heroes)

Cross-referenced from Google Sheets canonical roster + `delta-unity/Assets/GameScripts/Gameplays/Characters/*/`:

| Hero (canonical) | Code name | Abilities | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hercules | Hercules | Q W E R + N + Passive | ✅ Phase 2 pilot DONE |
| **Horus** | Horus | Q W E R + I | 🎯 **S6-03 (batch 1)** — BUG-0001 cousin |
| **Volund** | Volund | Q W E R + I | 🎯 **S6-04 (batch 1)** — BUG-0001 cousin |
| **Guan Yu** | GuanYu | Q W E R + I + N | 🎯 **S6-05 (batch 1)** — BUG-0001 cousin |
| **Skadi** | Skadi | Q W E R + I | 🎯 **S6-06 (batch 1)** — clean control case |
| Anansi | Anansi | Q W E R + I + N | Batch 2 (S7) |
| Athena | Athena | Q W E R + N + P | Batch 2 |
| King Arthur | KingArthur | Q W E R + N + P | Batch 2 |
| Koschei | Koschei | Q W E R + N + P | Batch 2 |

## Sprint 006 Batch 1 plan (S6-03 → S6-06)

Stories run **sequentially** to allow each migration to test patterns before the next, but reuse the proven Phase 2 infrastructure (no new ADRs required for this batch):

| Story | Hero | Why chosen | Est. |
|---|---|---|---|
| S6-03 | Horus | BUG-0001 cousin (HorusE/HorusR flagged) | 0.5d |
| S6-04 | Volund | BUG-0001 cousin (VolundW flagged) | 0.5d |
| S6-05 | Guan Yu | BUG-0001 cousin (GuanYuE flagged) + has W/R sub-systems | 0.5d |
| S6-06 | Skadi | Clean control case (no BUG-0001 history; 5 abilities; smallest codebase) | 0.5d |
| S6-07 | Batch gate | 1-match playtest + multipeer Pass #1-5 across all 4 | 0.5d |

**Combined Must Have**: 2.5d (within sprint capacity, soak permitting)

### Ordering revision 2026-05-18 (FINAL after BUG-0006 RESOLVED — Sprint 007 deferral RETRACTED)

After live diagnostic on 2026-05-18, BUG-0006 root cause was identified as a Unity AnimationEvent vs Animator StateMachineBehaviour timing race (NOT Phase 2 dual-path duplicate spawn as hypothesised at late-EOD-2). Fix landed at delta-unity `4ed9a04dda` (4 files, +42 lines): eager init of `m_Animator` + `m_Actor` on each `SkillStateMachine` at preload time. **BUG-0006 RESOLVED**.

**Sprint 007 Phase 4 deferral RETRACTED**: 672-caller migration is NOT required for BUG-0006 — that audit was based on the wrong root-cause hypothesis. Phase 4 (retire legacy CreateSkill + duplicate spawn cleanup) returns to its original schedule based on roadmap priorities, no BUG-0006 dependency.

**Per-hero AC #7 reverts to original (no known-regression workaround)**: manual playthrough verifies all abilities work first cast every match. The "cast twice as workaround" amendment is no longer needed.

**Phase 3 batch 1 critical path (FINAL)**:
```
2026-05-21  Soak verdict (PASS — BUG-0006 RESOLVED, no known regressions)
   ↓
   S6-03 Horus → S6-04 Volund → S6-05 Guan Yu → S6-06 Skadi → S6-07 batch gate
   0.5d × 5 = 2.5d
   ↓
2026-05-26 batch 1 complete (within Sprint 006, ends 2026-05-28)
```

Sprint 006 burn projection: ~5.35d (Day-4 wrap-up including BUG-0006 fix session) + ~2.5d (batch 1) = **~7.85d / 11d budget = -29% (well within budget)**.

---

### Original ordering revision proposal (RETRACTED — kept for audit trail)

After BUG-0006 cousin grep (2026-05-18 EOD-late) confirmed **Skadi has 0 dash API calls** (clean from `RequestDash` + `Dash()` overloads), the recommended kickoff order was changed:

```
Original: S6-03 Horus → S6-04 Volund → S6-05 Guan Yu → S6-06 Skadi
Revised:  S6-06 Skadi → [BUG-0006 fix parallel] → S6-03 Horus → S6-04 Volund → S6-05 Guan Yu
```

**Rationale**:
- Skadi has zero dash dependency → unblocks **the moment soak verdict signs** without waiting for BUG-0006 fix
- Skadi validates the non-dash slice of Phase 2 pipeline (BindSlot, StateReleaseSlot, multipeer parity, AC #1-7 except dash-specific verification) independently
- BUG-0006 fix runs parallel (~0.5d in NetworkStatusEffect.cs) — does not block Skadi work
- Once BUG-0006 fix verified on Hercules E + R, batch 1 continues with Horus → Volund → Guan Yu in original order
- Eliminates risk of contaminating 3 dash-bearing hero migrations simultaneously with a known dash-API bug

**Critical path**:
```
2026-05-21 soak verdict
   ↓
   ├── S6-06 Skadi START (0.5d) — non-dash pipeline validation
   ├── BUG-0006 fix (parallel, 0.5d) — verify Hercules E+R clean
   ↓
2026-05-23 (approx)
   ↓
   S6-03 Horus (0.5d) → S6-04 Volund (0.5d) → S6-05 Guan Yu (0.5d) → S6-07 gate (0.5d)
   ↓
2026-05-27 → batch 1 complete (within Sprint 006, ends 2026-05-28)
```

## Dependencies (all must be ✅ before batch 1 begins)

- ✅ Phase 2 Hercules pilot end-to-end (ADR-0006 §3 Exit Criteria 1-6 all PASS)
- ⏳ Phase 2 soak verdict (ends 2026-05-21) — no Hercules regressions filed
- ✅ `ActorCombat.OnStartup` reads CBSUnit.SlotQ..SlotI aliases (S5-09)
- ✅ `ActorCombat.GetSlotAction` + `IsQuickCast(byte)` facades (S5-02, S5-03)
- ✅ `ActorCombatAction.IsActiveSlotOwner` Pattern-A helper (S5-04)
- ✅ Pattern B/C/D one-liner replacements landed (S5-05)
- ✅ `AnimationEvent.StateReleaseSlot` 40-shim migration (S5-21)
- ✅ `Actor.Combat.SetActiveSlot` wired in `ActorCombatAction.Progress` setter (S5-21)
- ✅ `AbilityComponent` attached on `base_avatar.prefab` (S5-10 — propagates to all 25+ heroes)
- ✅ `AbilityRegistryService.prefab` in `DeltaConfiguration.Services` (S5-10 TD-007 fix)
- ✅ BUG-0001 fix at `AnimatorStateSync` (S5-19 PR #357 merged into dev)

## Per-story common shape

Every Phase 3 hero migration follows the same skeleton — only hero-specific code paths differ:

1. **CBS data audit** — verify `CBSUnit.SlotQ..SlotI` for the hero has correct ability IDs (PlayFab dashboard side; designer task or async user-side check)
2. **Code audit** — scan hero's `*Action.cs` files for hardcoded `SkillKey` references, hardcoded slot literals, or sibling-skill reads via `Combat.SkillN` direct properties (vs `GetSlotAction(slot)` facade)
3. **Pattern replacements** — apply Patterns A-D from Phase 2 (`IsActiveSlotOwner`, `IsInputSlotMatch`, `IsQuickCastForBoundSlot`, `MaxRank <= 1`) where the hero has those code shapes. Most heroes have far less SkillKey hardcoding than Hercules — many migrations are no-ops at the code level
4. **Bootstrap verification** — confirm `ActorCombat.OnStartup` BindSlot pipeline fires for the hero in production scene (no `BindSlot not registered` warnings)
5. **AnimationEvent verification** — confirm `StateReleaseSlot` dispatcher routes correctly for hero's animation events (verify the S5-21 fix applies)
6. **Multipeer parity** — Pass #1-5 green, bandwidth ≤65 B/s
7. **Manual playthrough** — Q/W/E/R + Normal Attack + Recall + Item all functional in `scene_game_map.unity`
8. **EditMode tests** — minimal slot-binding tests (per-hero file optional; shared base test class candidate for batch 2+)

## Risks shared across Phase 3 batch 1

- **R1 — Hero with unmigrated bot path**: bot using a Phase 3 hero may hit BUG-0004-style typos (S5-05 cousin) or PressedSlot=0 issues. **Mitigation**: S6-B1 fix shipped; spot-check bot for each migrated hero
- **R2 — CBS data row missing for hero**: if CBS Hero record lacks SlotQ..SlotI fill, BindSlot will fail silently for unfilled slots. **Mitigation**: S5-09 ISlotBinder logs warnings on `BindSlot not registered`; treat as hero-data ticket if surfaces
- **R3 — Hero has unique ability variant not covered by S5 patterns**: e.g., Mehmed's A variant (out of batch 1 scope). **Mitigation**: defer such heroes to later batches; document new pattern in `phase-2-lessons-learned.md`
- **R4 — Soak verdict surfaces regression**: if Phase 2 soak fails 2026-05-21, batch 1 blocks until fix lands. **Mitigation**: file P0 bug; pre-empt batch 1; sprint plan absorbs delay (Should Have / Nice slack covers ~3-4 days)

## Phase 3 → Phase 4 handover criteria (forward-looking)

Phase 4 (delete dual-path + retire SkillKey enum) starts when:
- All 15 remaining heroes migrated (batches 1-4)
- No `BoundSlot == 0` code path executed in production playtest for 1+ week
- No hero ability action file uses `SkillKey.X` literals (audit-grep clean)
- ADR-0006 §10 forward-handover gate criteria authored
